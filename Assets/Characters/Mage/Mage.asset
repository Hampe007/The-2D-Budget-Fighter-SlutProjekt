  lore: "Born beneath the Ember Isles, Sylvara\u2019s fire answered her heartbeat
    long before she learned to speak. She escaped the islands to the city\u2019s
    furnace districts, trading fear for spectacle and honing her craft in the street
    rings. Each bout is a ritual of control, turning raw flame into deliberate artistry
    as the crowd chants the name of the Flame Seer."
