## Recording checklist
- **Resolution:** 1920×1080 (game expects 1080p; lock 16:9). 
- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 (ResLock script enforces letterboxing if off). 
- **UI:** keep HUD on for most shots; capture a few tight HUD crops for health/mana emphasis. 
- **Audio:** record system/game audio; optional mic if you want controller clicks for a “hands-on” shot. 
- **Capture method:** run two instances (Host + Join) on the same PC; leave the opponent idle or alt-tab to position them, then record the active player’s window.
